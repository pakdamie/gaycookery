Caitlin's take on Ploughman's Lunch. A pasta for the adventurous.

1. Cook raisins in allspice and apple cider vinegar
2. Soft boil some eggs
3. Cook rotini pasta
4. Add crumbled blue cheese and butter to the cooked pasta 
5. Add one of the soft boiled eggs and let its yolk be part of the sauce
6. Add the raisins
7. Serve with soft boiled eggs and raw red onions

The final dish should have the strong blue cheese taste that pairs with the sweetness of the raisins.
