DP: Drove back, so Caitlin made her chili! More meaty due to the textured vegetable protein. Served with cornbread and sweet potatos-yum!

DP: Caitlin and I drove to southwest New York to stay at her friend's family homestead (It's gonna be an alpaca farm next year!) The host prepared "white people taco night" and I LOVED IT (first time I had it!). As a meat eater, I was able to get ground beef and shredded chicken cooked in sour cream. Seasoned well! I love all the condiments like chopped tomatos, iceberg lettuce, and red onions. Also their homemade salsa was good (They add dried red peppers) and man the pickled jalapenos were bomb. Caitlin's vegeterian so she had her sweet potatos and beans. White people taco night is 10/10.

DP: Caitlin got out of work early. So we went to a Japanese cafe in Brookline. She got her hand rolls and I got my pork tonkatsu. 

## October 16th, 2025
DP: I made gao baos with fried tofu and wood ear and shitake mix (braised in soy sauce and maple syrup). As condiments: cucumber, ginger-scallion, as well as spicy mayo. The gao baos I brought frozen (much better than my homemade ones).

DP: Caitlin made pasta that included *blue cheese and quick-pickled raisins seasoned with allspice*. To finish it, she added raw red onions and soft-boiled eggs. Caitlin was proud to call it [*"The Ploughman's Pasta"*](/posts/pasta_bc_raisin.qmd). The dish was paired with oven-roasted brussel sprouts coated in maple syrup and smoked paprika sauce. For drinks, I mixed home-made kvas with sparkling water and lime juice.

DP: We made fried rice. Typical: carrots, onions, garlic, garlic chives, green onions, and eggs. Seasoned generously with soy sauce and a ton of MSG. Served with leftover green beans.

## October 13th, 2025
DP: I made kimchi stew with canned tuna. Paired with frozen green bean, I did a tamarind based sauce. A play on Pad Thai with a generous amount of peanuts and garlic chives. Then I made oatbread which I paired with the new Trader Joe's Mimolette and apple. I was feeling more bread and apple for dinner. Caitlin ate bread, kimchi stew and rice, and cheese in the same bowl.
