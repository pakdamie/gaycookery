I made gao baos with fried tofu and wood ear and shitake mix (braised in soy sauce and maple syrup). As condiments: cucumber, ginger-scallion, as well as spicy mayo. The gao baos I brought frozen (much better than my homemade ones).

Caitlin made pasta that included *blue cheese and quick-pickled raisins seasoned with allspice*. To finish it, she added raw red onions and soft-boiled eggs. Caitlin was proud to call it *"The Ploughman's Pasta". The dish was paired with oven-roasted brussel sprouts coated in maple syrup and smoked paprika sauce. For drinks, I mixed home-made kvas with sparkling water and lime juice.

We made fried rice. Typical: carrots, onions, garlic, garlic chives, green onions, and eggs. Seasoned generously with soy sauce and a ton of MSG. Served with leftover green beans.

I made kimchi stew with canned tuna. Paired with frozen green bean, I did a tamarind based sauce. A play on Pad Thai with a generous amount of peanuts and garlic chives. Then I made oatbread which I paired with the new Trader Joe's Mimolette and apple. I was feeling more bread and apple for dinner. Caitlin ate bread, kimchi stew and rice, and cheese in the same bowl.
