Caitlin made pasta that included blue cheese and quick-pickled raisins seasoned with allspice. To finish it, she added raw red onions and soft-boiled eggs. The dish was paired with oven-roasted brussel sprouts coated in maple syrup and smoked paprika sauce. For drinks, I mixed home-made kvas with sparkling water with lime juice.
