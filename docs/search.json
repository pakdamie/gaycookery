Caitlin was proud to call it *“The Ploughman’s Pasta”. The dish was paired with oven-roasted brussel sprouts coated in maple syrup and smoked paprika sauce. For drinks, I mixed home-made kvas with sparkling water and lime juice."

A play on Pad Thai with a generous amount of peanuts and garlic chives. Then I made oatbread which I paired with the new Trader Joe’s Mimolette and apple. I was feeling more bread and apple for dinner. Caitlin ate bread, kimchi stew and rice, and cheese in the same bowl."
