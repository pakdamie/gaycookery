    "text": "October 18th, 2025\nDP: Caitlin and I drove to southwest New York to stay at her friend’s family homestead (It’s gonna be an alpaca farm next year!) The host prepared “white people taco night” and I LOVED IT (first time I had it!). As a meat eater, I was able to get ground beef and shredded chicken cooked in sour cream. Seasoned well! I love all the condiments like chopped tomatos, iceberg lettuce, and red onions. Also their homemade salsa was good (They add dried red peppers) and man the pickled jalapenos were bomb. Caitlin’s vegeterian so she had her sweet potatos and beans. White people taco night is 10/10."

Caitlin was proud to call it “The Ploughman’s Pasta”. The dish was paired with oven-roasted brussel sprouts coated in maple syrup and smoked paprika sauce. For drinks, I mixed home-made kvas with sparkling water and lime juice."

A play on Pad Thai with a generous amount of peanuts and garlic chives. Then I made oatbread which I paired with the new Trader Joe’s Mimolette and apple. I was feeling more bread and apple for dinner. Caitlin ate bread, kimchi stew and rice, and cheese in the same bowl."
