I love all the condiments like chopped tomatos, iceberg lettuce, and red onions. Also their homemade salsa was good (They add dried red peppers) and man the pickled jalapenos were bomb. Caitlin’s vegeterian so she had her sweet potatos and beans. White people taco night is 10/10."

I was feeling more bread and apple for dinner. Caitlin ate bread, kimchi stew and rice, and cheese in the same bowl."
